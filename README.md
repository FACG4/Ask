### WHY :question:
Simple web page that allows users to ask some other users questions.
### WHAT & HOW:question:
We created this web page to apply what we have studied during this week. So this is what we did:
* Created all the files required to run the database.
* Created the functions required to get data from database and post(insert) data into database.
* Created html files to dislay the selected data, and allow users to post data to database.
* Funally, we added some simple style.
